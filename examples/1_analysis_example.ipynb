    "SBT Temperature Scoring. The latter two methods, Portfolio Coverage and Temperature Scoring, require assessing the targets\n",
    "disclosed by the companies within a financial institution's portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial institutions may use the portfolio coverage and/or [temperature scoring methods](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Temperature-Rating-Methodology-V1.pdf)\n",
    "to set targets for their corporate instruments, including corporate debt, listed equity and bonds, and private equity and\n",
    "debt (See relevant “Required Activities” in Table 5-2 of the [SBTi guidance](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Financial-Sector-Science-Based-Targets-Guidance-Pilot-Version.pdf)\n",
    "to drive adoption of science-based targets).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the *portfolio coverage method*, financial institutions commit to engaging with their investees to set their own\n",
    "approved science-based targets, such that the financial institution is on a linear path to 100% SBT portfolio coverage by 2040. As the fulfillment of portfolio coverage targets mean that investees’ SBTs have been approved by SBTi, the 2040 timeline\n",
    "has been determined to allow companies enough time to implement their target to ultimately achieve an economy-wide transition\n",
    "to net zero by 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the *temperature scoring method*, financial institutions determine the current temperature score of their portfolio\n",

    "score to a long-term temperature goal (e.g. 2°C, well-below 2°C, 1.5°C).\n",
    "The temperature scoring method is an open source framework to enable the translation of corporate GHG emission reduction\n",

    "aggregation of target level scores to generate a temperature rating for a company based on the ambition of its targets.\n",
