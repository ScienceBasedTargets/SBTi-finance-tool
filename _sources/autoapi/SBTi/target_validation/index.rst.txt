.. py:class:: TargetProtocol(config: Type[PortfolioAggregationConfig] = PortfolioAggregationConfig)

   This class validates the targets, to make sure that only active, useful targets are considered. It then combines the targets with company-related data into a dataframe where there's one row for each of the nine possible target types (short, mid, long * S1+S2, S3, S1+S2+S3). This class follows the procedures outlined by the target protocol that is a part of the "Temperature Rating Methodology" (2020), which has been created by CDP Worldwide and WWF International.

   :param config: A Portfolio aggregation config

   .. method:: process(self, targets: List[IDataProviderTarget], companies: List[IDataProviderCompany])


      Process the targets and companies, validate all targets and return a data frame that combines all targets and company data into a 9-box grid.

      :param targets: A list of targets
      :param companies: A list of companies
      :return: A data frame that combines the processed data


   .. method:: validate(self, target: IDataProviderTarget)


      Validate a target, meaning it should:

      * Have a valid type
      * Not be finished
      * A valid end year

      :param target: The target to validate
      :return: True if it's a valid target, false if it isn't


   .. method:: _split_s1s2s3(self, target: IDataProviderTarget)


      If there is a s1s2s3 scope, split it into two targets with s1s2 and s3

      :param target: The input target
      :return The split targets or the original target and None


   .. method:: _combine_s1_s2(self, target: IDataProviderTarget)


      Check if there is an S2 target that matches this target exactly (if this is a S1 target) and combine them into one target.

      :param target: The input target
      :return: The combined target (or the original if no combining was required)


   .. method:: _convert_s1_s2(self, target: IDataProviderTarget)


      Convert a S1 or S2 target into a S1+S2 target.

      :param target: The input target
      :return: The converted target (or the original if no conversion was required)


   .. method:: _boundary_coverage(self, target: IDataProviderTarget)


      Test on boundary coverage:

      Option 1: minimal coverage threshold
      For S1+S2 targets: coverage% must be above 95%, for S3 targets coverage must be above 67%

      Option 2: weighted coverage
      Thresholds are still 95% and 67%, target is always valid. Below threshold ambition is scaled.*
      New target ambition = input target ambition * coverage
      *either here or in tem score module

      Option 3: default coverage
      Target is always valid, % uncovered is given default score in temperature score module.

      :param target: The input target
      :return: The original target with a weighted reduction ambition, if so required


   .. method:: _time_frame(self, target: IDataProviderTarget)


      Time frame is forward looking: target year - current year. Less than 5y = short, between 5 and 15 is mid, 15 to 30 is long

      :param target: The input target
      :return: The original target with the time_frame field filled out (if so required)


   .. method:: _prepare_target(self, target: IDataProviderTarget)


      Prepare a target for usage later on in the process.

      :param target:
      :return:


   .. method:: prepare_targets(self, targets: List[IDataProviderTarget])



   .. method:: _find_target(self, row: pd.Series, target_columns: List[str])


      Find the target that corresponds to a given row. If there are multiple targets available, filter them.

      :param row: The row from the data set that should be looked for
      :param target_columns: The columns that need to be returned
      :return: returns records from the input data, which contains company and target information, that meet specific criteria. For example, record of greatest emissions_in_scope


   .. method:: group_targets(self)


      Group the targets and create the 9-box grid (short, mid, long * s1s2, s3, s1s2s3).
      Group valid targets by category & filter multiple targets#
      Input: a list of valid targets for each company:
      For each company:

      Group all valid targets based on scope (S1+S2 / S3 / S1+S2+S3) and time frame (short / mid / long-term)
      into 6 categories.

      For each category: if more than 1 target is available, filter based on the following criteria
      -- Highest boundary coverage
      -- Latest base year
      -- Target type: Absolute over intensity
      -- If all else is equal: average the ambition of targets
