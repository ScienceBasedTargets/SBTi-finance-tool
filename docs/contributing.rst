Contributing
********************
Any contribution is highly appreciated. The most common way to contribute to the project is through coding, however contributions to
the documentation are also very welcome.

Submitting a bug report or a feature request
==============================================
To keep track of open issues and feature requests, we will use `Github's issue tracker <https://github.com/ScienceBasedTargets/SBTi-finance-tool/issues/>`_.

If you encounter any bugs or missing features, please do not hesitate to open a ticket. Before submitting a report, please check that the issue has not already been reported.
For ease of comprehension, please ensure your report includes the following characteristics:

* Reproducible: It should be possible for others to reproduce the issue, ideally through a small code snippet in the description of the issue
* Labelled: Add a label that describes the contents of the ticket, e.g. "bug", "feature request" or "documentation"

Contributing code
====================
Our preferred way for contributing code is to fork the repository, make changes on your personal fork and then create a pull request to merge your changes back into the main repository. 
Before a pull request can be approved it needs to be reviewed by two core contributors, then these automated checks need to be passed (see "Coding Guidelines" section below).

.. note:: Please assign the issue you are working on to yourself so we can avoid duplicate efforts.

Getting started
-----------------
Before getting started it is important to have a clean Python environment. The recommended Python version is 3.6 or higher. 
An anaconda environment file is provided in the root of the project, as is a PIP requirements.txt file. 
The easiest way to work on the Python module is by installing it in development mode. This can be done using the following command::

    pip install -e .[dev]

This will install the module as a reference to your current directory.
The Jupyter notebooks in the "examples" directory have been setup to use auto-reload. Thus, if you now make any changes to your local code, they will be automatically reflected in the notebook.

Coding guidelines
-------------------
In general the code follows three principals, `OOP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`_, `PEP8 (code style) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ and `PEP 484 (type hinting) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_.
In addition, we use Flake8 to lint the code, MyPy to check the type hints and Nose2 to do unit testing. These checks are done automatically when attempting to merge a pull request into master.

Releasing
===============
To release a new version of the module you need to take two steps, create a new PyPi release and generate the documentation.


Generate documentation
------------------------
To generate the documentation, you should follow these steps in the "SBTi" repository (the one containing the Python module).

1. `cd docs`

2. `make html`

3. Copy the contents of the `docs/_build/` folder into the `gh_pages` branch

4. Start the FastAPI server from the `SBTi_api` branch

5. Go to `the docs <http://127.0.0.1/openapi.json>`_ and copy this file to the "swagger" directory in the `gh_pages` branch.

6. Commit and push the gh_pages branch


Code of conduct
===============
Everyone's goals here are aligned: to help asset owners and asset managers reduce their impact on climate change.
The only way we can achieve this goal is by fostering an inclusive and welcome environment. Therefore, this project is governed by a `code of conduct <https://github.com/ScienceBasedTargets/SBTi-finance-tool/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. If you encounter any violations, please report them.
